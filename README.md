## üéØ What This Demonstrates

This proof-of-concept showcases how Large Language Models can assist healthcare providers in generating personalized care plans while maintaining essential clinical oversight. The system demonstrates a **human-in-the-loop approach** where AI generates initial care plans that require clinician review and approval before implementation.

## üîç Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses OpenAI GPT models to create initial care plans from patient data
- **Clinical Review Workflow**: All AI-generated plans require clinician approval before activation
- **Batch Processing**: Demonstrates scalable processing of multiple patient records
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate interfaces for patients, clinicians, and administrators

### Demo Workflow
1. **Patient Data Input**: Upload patient information via CSV or manual entry
2. **AI Generation**: LLM processes patient data to create initial care plans
3. **Clinical Review**: Clinicians review, modify, and approve AI-generated plans
4. **Patient Access**: Approved plans become available in patient portal
